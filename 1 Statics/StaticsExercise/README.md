- Define acceleration as a constant in the static class `ScientificFormulas`!  
  The gravitational acceleration is **9.81**.  
- Formulas:  
  - **Gravity Force** = mass × gravitational acceleration  
  - **Work** = force × displacementInMeters  
  - **Power** = work × duration  
  - **Gravitational Potential Energy** = mass × gravitational acceleration × heightInMeters  
    → Use the **gravity force** formula
