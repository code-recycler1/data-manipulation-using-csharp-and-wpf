# Singular Relationships Example

This solution demonstrates the implementation of singular relationships in a .NET Framework 4.8 application using WPF. The solution is divided into three main projects.
## Projects

### SingularRelationshipsExample_WPF
This project is a WPF application that serves as the front-end for the example. It includes the necessary XAML and code-behind files to create the user interface.

### SingularRelationshipsExample_Models
This project contains the data models used in the application. The `Software` class, which extends the `Product` class, is an example of a model in this project.

### SingularRelationshipsExample_DAL
This project contains the data access layer (DAL) for the application. It is responsible for interacting with the data storage and providing data to the WPF application.
